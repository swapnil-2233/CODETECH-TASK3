TASK NAME-MIGRATE DATA BETWEEN TWO DATABASES (E.G., FROM MYSQL TO POSTGRESQL) AND ENSURE DATA INTEGRITYDELIVERABLE: MIGRATION SCRIPTS AND A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE PROCESS.
FEATURE-### Short Description:

The task involves migrating data from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL database while ensuring data integrity throughout the process. This includes extracting data from MySQL, transforming it if necessary (to match PostgreSQL’s data types and structure), and loading it into PostgreSQL. Special attention will be given to ensuring data consistency, handling constraints, and resolving any compatibility issues.

The deliverables include:
1. **Migration Scripts** – SQL or script-based code to automate data transfer between the databases.
2. **Summary Report** – A comprehensive report detailing the migration process, including challenges, steps taken to ensure data integrity, and final results.

### Steps in the Process:
1. **Database Schema Review**: Analyze the source (MySQL) and target (PostgreSQL) databases for schema compatibility.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from MySQL using tools like `mysqldump` or custom queries.
3. **Data Transformation**: Modify the data as necessary to conform to PostgreSQL’s data types and structure.
4. **Data Loading**: Import the data into PostgreSQL using tools like `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, or custom scripts.
5. **Data Integrity Checks**: Implement consistency checks and validate that all data is transferred correctly, without corruption.
6. **Post-Migration Testing**: Test queries, indexes, relationships, and application functionality to ensure proper migration.
7. **Documentation**: Provide a detailed summary of the migration process, including any issues faced and resolutions.

### Conclusion:
The migration process ensures that the data in the PostgreSQL database is consistent with the original MySQL database while handling possible pitfalls during the transition.
